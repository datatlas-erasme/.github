# Welcome to DatAtlas contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! 

Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/datatlas-erasme/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](https://github.com/datatlas-erasme/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Frontend setup](https://github.com/datatlas-erasme/front#readme) 
- [Backend setup](https://github.com/datatlas-erasme/back#readme)

## Getting started

Our code is divided in two main repos : [front](https://github.com/datatlas-erasme/front) and [back](https://github.com/datatlas-erasme/back) 
You may also be interested in the [build](https://github.com/datatlas-erasme/build) repo to deploy a new datatlas instance. 

## Issues

### Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.
Feel free to use tags, useful to ordonate issues. 

### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. 
You can narrow down the search using labels as filters.  If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
Some issues are already assigned to someone. In this case, ask the assignees if you would like to work with them.

Additionally, issues are prioritized through milestones. Each milestone has a deadline.
For the most urgent problems, a person is usually already assignated. For the others (without milestone) your help is welcome without any time target.

## Make changes in a codespace

Create a working branch and start with your changes!

Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. 

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review to speed up the review processzap.

We use eslint to have a homogeneous code, take care of the quality of your code ;)

## Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.

## Your PR is merged!
