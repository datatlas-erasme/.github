### Who are we ? 

DatAtlas is a project created by Erasme, the open innovation lab of the Metropolis of Lyon. Meet our team [here](https://www.erasme.org/-A-propos-) 
The project is supported by [France Relance](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/plan-de-relance). 

### Inside the code
DatAtlas uses Kepler.gl for its frontend. Kepler.gl is an open-sourced, data-agnostic, high-performance web-based application for visual exploration of large-scale geolocation data sets. Built on top of Mapbox GL and deck.gl, kepler.gl can render millions of points representing thousands of trips and perform spatial aggregations on the fly.
Discover mor about Kepler [here](https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl) 
The frontend, from an instance conf file, creates a custom web interactive map. 

The backend uses an other JS technology : node.js.  
The backend is a specific ETL that allows DatAtlas to grab data from everywhere.
